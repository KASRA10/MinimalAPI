# Minimal API Training and Practice

## Introduction
This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with Minimal APIs, a lightweight approach to building web APIs using ASP.NET Core. The repository serves as a fundamental guide for developers looking to understand and implement minimal APIs efficiently.

## About
Minimal APIs are a simplified way to create RESTful APIs with minimal dependencies and configurations. This project includes practical exercises to help developers get familiar with the core concepts and structure of Minimal APIs.

## What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs enable data exchange and functionality integration between systems.

## What is a RESTful API?
RESTful APIs follow the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), using standard HTTP methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. They provide stateless, scalable, and flexible web services.

## What is a Minimal API?
Minimal APIs in ASP.NET Core offer a streamlined way to create APIs without requiring extensive configurations or controllers. They are ideal for microservices and small applications, focusing on simplicity and performance.

## Benefits and Usage of APIs
- **Interoperability**: APIs allow different applications to communicate regardless of platform or language.
- **Scalability**: APIs enable modular application development.
- **Security**: API gateways and authentication mechanisms enhance application security.
- **Efficiency**: APIs reduce development time by allowing reusable components.

## What is Middleware in an API?
Middleware in an API acts as an intermediary layer that processes requests and responses. It handles authentication, logging, error handling, and request modifications before they reach the main application logic.
